I am Miguel López-Pérez, a postdoctoral Juan de la Cierva fellow at the [Universitat Politècnica de València](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) under the supervision of [Valery Naranjo](https://www.upv.es/ficha-personal/vnaranjo) at the [CVBLab](https://www.cvblab.webs.upv.es/en/home/). I do research in methodology of machine learning and its applications (mainly) to the medical imaging domain. I have a wide experience in computational pathology and probabilistic models. I am also interested in topics related to fairness, generative models, uncertainty quantification, and explainability.
