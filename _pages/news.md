### ðŸ“… Apr 18, 2025 - New Histopathology dataset published at Scientific data
The AI4SkIN dataset is out! Check it out. It contains 641 WSIs from 2 Spanish hospitals with
multiple annotators.

### ðŸ“… March 26, 2025 - New paper accepted at SCIA!
[New paper accept](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11752) during my visit to DTU. Are generative models fair? In this paper, we study the racial bias in dermatology images using a VAE.

### ðŸ“… March 18, 2025 - New preprint!
[New preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17477) during my visit to DTU. We explore the extension of UQ methods to high-dimensional output models as VAE in medical imaging.

### ðŸ“… Jan 1, 2025 â€” Starting a new visit at DTU funded by JosÃ© Castillejo fellowship
I started a new visit to DTU. I'm going to resume some exciting topics about UQ and fairness with Aasa and SÃ¸ren. 

### ðŸ“… Dec 28, 2024 â€” New university project!
I've been granted with a small project from my university to do trustworthy AI models for skin cancer. These funds will allow me to go to some conferences next year and buy new material!

### ðŸ“… Jun 17, 2024 â€” New MICCAI paper
Our MICCAI's submission with Natalia have been accepted publication! It's about domain adaptation in anomaly detection for whole slide images.

### ðŸ“… Jun 1, 2024 â€” Visit to DTU
I have started a 4-month visit at DTU under the supervision of Aasa Feragen and SÃ¸ren Hauberg. I'll explore UQ and fairnes in generative models. Pretty exciting!

### ðŸ“… Jan 1, 2024 â€” New Postdoctoral fellowship start
I'm starting as a Juan de la Cierva fellow at the Universitat PolitÃ¨cnica de ValÃ¨ncia (UPV).
I'm truly thrilled, as this is one of the most competitive postdoctoral fellowships for early-career researchers.
